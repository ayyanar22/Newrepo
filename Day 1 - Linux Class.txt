User ---> Shell-->Kernel---> hardware    bash

Kernel will act as a intermediate between the hardware and OS (operating system)

Shell will act as a intermediate between the user and OS (operating system)

Therer are 8 types of shells :
1.Bourne Shell (sh)
2.GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash)  --> We will be using Bash shell
3.C Shell (csh)
4.korn Shell (ksh)
5.Shell (zsh)


We will be using Bash shell:

What does bash means?
Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the free and enhanced version of the Bourne shell distributed with Linux and GNU operating systems.

What bash is used for?
People use Bash when they want to control their computer or OS without having to navigate menus, options, and windows within a GUI. 
As we pointed out earlier, with CLIs like Bash, you usually don't even need to use your mouse. 
You can navigate through your computer's OS without your fingers ever leaving your keyboard 

Shell Basics :
1.Commands  ---> To run 
Eg: ls --> will  list the directory and file names

2.Options   ---> To change the behaviour of the commands
Eg : ls -l ---> will list in details of the directory and folders

3.Arguments ---> Which are the target of the commands
Eg: Ls -l downloads 
Ls is a comment
L is a options 
Downloads will be a arguments.

Commends :

Ls -- Will list the directory contents 

Ls -a ---> will show the hidden files and directory.

Ls -l or ll ---> will list the details of the folders ( eg: with date and permissions)

ls "directory name or file name" --->  will show all the files under the directory or file.
Eg : ls /boot ---> will show the files under "boot"

ls -l "directory name or file name" --> will show all the details of the folder under the directory or file.
Eg : ls -l /boot ---> Will show all the details(permisson, date, time, file name) of the file under "boot"

su---> switch user (To switch from one user to another user)
Synext : su - username 
Eg : su -root

sudo - super user 

Root user ---> Will have all the access 

pwd ----> present working directory or print working directory 

logout or exit or ctrl+d ---> will logout the current user 

In Every terminal backend bash shell will be running to check that we need user "ps" commend
